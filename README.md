# Linux_Bash_Scripts
This is a Repo of some Bash scripts I created myself and through a DevOps course I have taken.
Including but not limited to having my close sourced Bluetooth hardware work on my system, and other useful scripts.
I will be updating and adding more whenever I create another useful Bash script.
